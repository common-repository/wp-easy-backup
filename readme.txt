== Description ==

"WP Easy Backup" is a WordPress plugin that will create a database dump, backup all your media, theme and plugin files, and export it all in a nice zip file.

When moving from one hosting company to another, this plugin can quickly create a website backup with everything you need in a zip file, with just one click.

After installation, look under the Tools tab in the left-hand navigation of your WordPress Dashboard. Then, click "WP Easy Backup". To create a website backup, click on "Generate WP Easy Backup Zip" to start your backup.  The website backup may take up to 60-90+ seconds to complete depending on how much content and how many pictures your website has.

Once the website backup is complete you will be notified and will be able to download a zip file to your computer with all the contents of your website.

When you unzip the folder you will see all your website data. 

The database dump will be located within the uploads folder.
